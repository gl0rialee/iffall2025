        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        
        <p>1. Gloria Lee, Communication Design, Junior</p>


        <p>2. I am from South Korea. I thought this class would help me in various areas, in terms of expanding my knowledge of design as well as helping me build my portfolio.</p>


        <p>3. No, I don't have prior experience.</p>


        <p>4. I hope to learn the basics of HTML and CSS so I can later build my own website.</p>


        <p>5. I think designing from screen can be more complicated at times if I don't know the exact tools and ways.</p>


        <p>6. <a href="https://abetkaua.com/en/">Abetka:Typeface Alphabet of Ukrainian Identity</a></p>
        <p>I thought this website had an effective design because there is a lot of typographic storytelling going on and the engaging interactive elements make the wesbite very interesting. There is a striking contrast in both the layout and colors. While it seems minimalistic, some bold elements make this website stand out.</p>


        <p>7. <a href="https://www.rhodeskin.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&utm_content={{adgroup.name}}&utm_term={rhode%20beauty}&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=22918307483&utm_adgroup=187221450474&utm_content=763273078777&utm_term=rhode%20beauty&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=22918307483&gbraid=0AAAAAok-sx9SB32PD76AqGA8UO9snC2Bd&gclid=CjwKCAjw2brFBhBOEiwAVJX5GEheRX2hog1AQWMOlyBCzlONBJJkGs5fsXGcRgZNDaaS2u_wuW8SzhoCANUQAvD_BwE">Rhode Beauty</a></p>
        <p>I think Rhode beauty's website is a good example of a website with effective communication. With it's bold choice of size and type, it grabs the audience's attention and delivers their information at best. Also, the clean edges and structures match well with the brand's identity.</p>

        
        <p>8. <a href="https://www.apple.com/siri/">Apple Siri</a></p>
        <p>I think this website works effectively overall. It has a minimalist style, yet it clearly delivers the content and ensures the product is prioritized than anything else. It has a dynamic layout and fluid animations making the website fun to look at.</p>
