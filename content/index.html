            <p><strong>Description: </strong> Fluffy and moist, these buttery red velvet cupcakes are my favorite. The tangy cream cheese frosting puts them over the top!</p>
            <p><strong>Instructions: </strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Soften the butter. </li>
                <li>Add sugar and whip until they are ivory colored. (beat until sugar is dissolved) </li>
                <li>Continue whipping while adding eggs little by little so that the dough doesn't separate. </li>
                <li>Add vanilla extract and mix. Preheat the oven to 180°C. </li>
                <li>Sift together flour, all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix the ingredients as if you are cutting through, and mix until the flour is no longer visible. </li>
                <li>Add the milk in by dividing them among 2-3 portions little by little and mix gently. </li>
                <li>Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of liquid food coloring until you get the red color you want. </li>
                <li>Fill the muffin tin lined with parchment paper around 60-70% with the batter. </li>
                <li>Bake at 170°C for 20-25 minutes. (time and temperature may vary depending on the oven) </li>
                <li>Let it sit in the pan for 3 minutes, then transfer it to a cooling rack and let it cool completely. </li>
                <li>Soften the cream cheese that was at room temperature. </li>
                <li>Add sugar to the whipping cream in a separate bowl and whip until it becomes stiff. </li>
                <li>Add the whipped cream to the cream cheese in about two portions and mix thoroughly. </li>
                <li>Transfer the frosting to a piping bag and pipe large dollops of frosting on top of the cooled cupcakes. (I used a 2cm diameter nozzle) </li>
                <li>Decorate the muffin using leftover muffin crumbs or other ingredients of your choice. </li>
            </ol>
