            <p><strong>Description: </strong> Fluffy and moist, these buttery red velvet cupcakes are my favorite. The tangy cream cheese frosting puts them over the top!</p>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>Instructions: </strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Soften the butter. </li>
                <li>Add sugar and whip until they are ivory colored. (beat until sugar is dissolved) </li>
                <li>Continue whipping while adding eggs little by little so that the dough doesn't separate. </li>
                <li>Add vanilla extract and mix. Preheat the oven to 180°C. </li>
                <li>Sift together flour, all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix the ingredients as if you are cutting through, and mix until the flour is no longer visible. </li>
                <li>Add the milk in by dividing them among 2-3 portions little by little and mix gently. </li>
                <li>Use 1 to 2 tablespoons of liquid food coloring until you get the red color you want. </li>
                <li>Fill the muffin tin lined with parchment paper around 60-70% with the batter. </li>
                <li>Bake at 170°C for 20-25 minutes. (time and temperature may vary depending on the oven) </li>
                <li>Let it sit in the pan for 3 minutes, then transfer it to a cooling rack and let it cool completely. </li>
                <li>Soften the cream cheese that was at room temperature. </li>
                <li>Add sugar to the whipping cream in a separate bowl and whip until it becomes stiff. </li>
                <li>Add the whipped cream to the cream cheese in about two portions and mix thoroughly. </li>
                <li>Transfer the frosting to a piping bag and pipe large dollops of frosting on top of the cooled cupcakes. (I used a 2cm diameter nozzle) </li>
                <li>Decorate the muffin using leftover muffin crumbs or other ingredients of your choice. </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Recipe Websites</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/12372-vietnamese-inspired-cabbage-salad-with-tofu">The New York Time</a>'s cooking recipe has a an elegant typography and high quality photo, creating a clean and simple style. The list of ingredients, steps, and notes are all well separated, yet are aligned at the same starting line, so they look cohesive and are easy to look at. The “Cooking Notes” and reader comments also make it feel community-driven and friendly. Out of all the recipes, I would say the New York Time's recipe is the easiest to look at visually.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-riggies">Bon Appetite</a>'s recipe has a bit of unecessary description about the food at the beginning, but it has a "Jump to the Recipe" button which makes it easy to move on to the main information. The subtitles are in bigger, heavier fonts and are divided with the main text by line and spacing which makes it easy for the readers to divide the information. If I were to incoporate an element from this recipe website, I would use the text styles they use here.

                    This recipe by <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/new-orleans-sno-balls-recipe-11804217">serious eats</a> is effective in how it has a lot of pictures to help visualize the audience in what they are making. Also, except for the description text, they start off with the ingredients, which help the audience prepare for cooking first. There is a lot of detail in the steps to help the audience guide through the steps thoroughly as well. Furthermore, there is information about 'Variations', 'Special Equipment', 'Notes', and 'Make-Ahead and Storage.'

                <li>
                    <a href="https://crumblcookies.com/">Crumbl</a> cookie's page works effectively stylistically and communicationally. The clean grid layout, generous whitespace, and large scales of images keep the focus on products. The ordering flow is linear and intuitive which makes it easy to see, while the cute type and button hover animations matches the brand's identity. I would want to incorporate this hover animation stylistically into my own website.

                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.nike.com/">Nike</a>’s website is effective because it has a clear and easy navigation. The structured layouts help people to easily find or keep track of what they are looking for. If I were to use an element in this website into my own, I would utilize the neat structure and layout so that the audience can eaisly navigate the steps or ingredients they need for the recipe.

                    I like the style of the <a href="https://www.toofaced.com/product/23479/111688/face-makeup/blush/cloud-crush-blurring-blush#/shade/Candy_Clouds">Too Faced</a> website.The design leans into its girly aesthetic—pink backgrounds, ribbon motifs, and glitter accents, immediately signaling the brand’s personality and appealing to its core audience. Despite all the decorative elements, the navigation stays simple and the product photographs are large, which allow the audience to easily read information. I thought this website best matched the vibe I would want to achieve in my recipe website.
